# C SHARP:> Part A

Using a combination of YouTube videos and online resources with the links highlighted below, let us first install the Visual Studio IDE (NOT VS Code) Community Edition to run code in the C# environment. Here are the steps to install the Visual Studio IDE for C# (Community Edition):

### Step 1: Download Visual Studio Installer

1. Open your web browser and go to the Visual Studio download page: [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. Under the "Community" section, click on the **Free download** button for "Visual Studio Community".

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Once the download is complete, run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file (usually named something like `vs_installer.exe`).

### Step 3: Install Visual Studio

1. When the Visual Studio Installer launches, you will see a list of workloads. These are groups of related tools and libraries. For C# development, select the **.NET desktop development** workload.
2. You can also select additional workloads if you plan to do web development, game development, or other types of projects.
3. In the **Summary** section on the right, you can review the components that will be installed. You can customize this if you want, but the defaults are usually sufficient.
4. Click the **Install** button.

### Step 4: Wait for Installation to Complete

1. The installer will download and install the necessary components. This may take some time depending on your internet speed and the selected workloads.
2. Once the installation is complete, click the **Launch** button to start Visual Studio.

### Step 5: Sign In (Optional)

1. When you launch Visual Studio for the first time, you may be prompted to sign in with a Microsoft account. This step is optional but signing in can provide benefits like syncing your settings across devices.
2. If you donâ€™t want to sign in, you can choose to **Not now, maybe later** to skip this step.

### Step 6: Start a New C# Project

1. After launching Visual Studio, you will see the start window. Click on **Create a new project**.
2. In the **Create a new project** window, select **Console App** or **Windows Forms App** (or any other project type you are interested in) and click **Next**.
3. Name your project, choose a location to save it, and click **Create**.

### Step 7: Write and Run Your C# Code

1. Visual Studio will create a new project and open the code editor.
2. You can start writing your C# code in the editor. For example, in a console application, you will see a `Program.cs` file where you can write your `Main` method.
3. To run your project, click the **Start** button (a green arrow) at the top of the IDE or press `F5`.

That's it! You've installed Visual Studio Community Edition and are ready to start developing in C#.
